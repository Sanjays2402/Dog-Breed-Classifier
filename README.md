# Udacity Deep learning Nanodegree Program


## Project 2: Dog Breed Classification in PyTorch

Build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Import Datasets

* Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  
* Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).


### Note:

* The CNN model developed from scratch achieves a test accuracy of 15%.

* A [pre-trained ResNet-50 model](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html#id3) used to classify dog breeds achieves very high test accuracy of 81%.
